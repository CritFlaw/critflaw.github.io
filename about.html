                <p>
                    In 2018 I decided to pursue my high-school passion and begin a development based career. Starting with my experience at Trios and my internship at NewCo I quickly learned the basics of the industry and grew into my role as a front-end developer.

                <p>
                    My main expertise is in React and Node.JS, as well as a strong knowledge of C# and Java. Though I know my way around the back-end side of things, I wouldn't call myself a back-end or full-stack developer just yet. I'm passionate about the way web development has evolved in the past ten years, and I am always excited to learn new APIs, frameworks, and libraries, but as mentioned above, my strongest abilities are in specific JavaScript frameworks and mid-level general-purpose languages like C#.

                <p>
                    I'm happy to say that I have several certifications, including one in C#, Java, as well as MySQL. I'm constnatly looking to improve my skillset, and I belive there's no better way to show that, than to have credentials that quantitatively show your abilities as a developer.
